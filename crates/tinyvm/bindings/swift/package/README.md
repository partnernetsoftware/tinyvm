# TinyArcadeRuntime Swift package

This generated package is the iOS app integration artifact. It contains the
device/simulator `TinyArcade.xcframework` and the main-actor Swift ownership
and media-decoding wrapper as one `TinyArcadeRuntime` library product.

The generated package is physically bundled-only: external distribution policy,
HTTP/catalog, trust/cache, reviewed-library and private-import Swift APIs are
compiled out unless the source is built with
`TINYARCADE_EXTERNAL_CARTRIDGES`. The repository's SDK black boxes define that
flag to keep developing those paths, but App Store package generation does not.
Do not add it to an iOS product until Apple has approved the exact custom WASM
use case and a separate release review re-enables the surface deliberately.

Call `TinyArcadeCartridgeDescriptorV1.inspect(_:)` before presenting an import.
It statically validates the standard WASM manifest, lifecycle exports and exact
function import table without instantiating or executing the cartridge, then
reports identity and required versioned native capabilities. The private
library uses this same descriptor to return
`unsupportedNativeCapabilities` before core-only runtime preflight.

Call `TinyArcadeHostProfileV1.appBuild` with the same config and native
functions as the app runtime to export canonical TAH1 bytes for converters.
`inspectCompatibleCartridge` checks an exact standard import/resource profile
without instantiating the guest or calling handlers, and returns the canonical
TAD1 description produced under that same profile rather than reparsing under
defaults. Dynamic fuel/output and native semantics remain separate
reviewed-game gates.
Use `compatibilityReport(for:)` when creator UI needs every missing or
wrong-signature import and every unavailable target-build Wasm feature as typed
data. Compatibility requires both an empty `unsupportedFeatures` option set and
zero import issues; both outcomes remain callback-free.
The render, audio and state ceilings preserve zero exactly as a disabled or
empty-only channel; TAH1 never rewrites zero to a default or to unlimited.

When an official catalog includes `host_profile`, call
`TinyArcadeHTTPSClientV1.fetchHostProfile(_:matching:)` with the locally
generated App-build profile. The request is same-origin and exactly bounded;
success requires byte-for-byte equality with the local profile. Catalog
length/hash fields support discovery and converter content addressing, but do
not authorize a different native module or resource limit in the App.

Use `tickMedia` for the discriminated `grid3d/v1` or `indexed2d/v1` render
frame. Existing Depth Well integrations may keep using the `grid3d/v1`-only
`tick` convenience. The runtime alternates between two Swift render/audio
output slots, so the ordinary `frame = try runtime.tickMedia(...)` pattern can
retain the visible previous frame while the next slot is filled and then reuse
both allocations after warm-up. Retaining more history remains safe: Swift
copy-on-write separates an occupied slot rather than mutating an older frame.
A warm non-empty slot passes its prior length directly to the C ABI, so stable
output takes one copy call; an empty or growing output negotiates and retries.

For 3D cartridges, render with `TinyArcadeGrid3DFrame.forEachCell`. It walks
typed, validated cell values directly over the frame's immutable storage and
does not allocate a second per-frame array. The `cells` property remains a
compatibility materialization for non-hot paths.

After init or any tick/suspend/resume attempt, call `lastExecutionStats()` for
deterministic Wasm instruction, memory/table, native-dispatch and output-byte
evidence. Guest traps update the record; host input rejected before execution
does not. Measure device wall time and process memory separately.

For indexed cartridges, `TinyArcadeIndexed2DFrame.makeCGImage()` provides an
exact sRGB RGBA image and `TinyArcadeIndexed2DView` is a ready-to-layout UIKit
surface with aspect-fit, nearest-neighbour presentation. The view reuses its
dimension-bound pixel storage and bitmap context across frames, borrowing both
the palette and pixel planes from the frame's one immutable allocation. Custom
native renderers can reuse their own storage through `rgba8888ByteCount` and
the checked `writeRGBA8888(into:)`, or use `paletteCount`,
`withPaletteBytes` and `withPixelBytes` directly for Metal. `paletteRGBA` and
`pixels` remain explicit compatibility materializations for non-hot paths.

For audio feedback, pass `TinyArcadeMediaFrame.tones` to
`TinyArcadeTonePlayer.play(_:)`. The default player uses a mixing `.ambient`
audio session; use `TinyArcadeTonePlayer(managesAudioSession: false)` when the
app already owns session policy. The player observes audio interruptions,
media-services resets and loss of an old route by default: it stops rather than
replaying or rerouting a stale gameplay cue, then lazily rebuilds on the next
event. Pass `observesAudioSessionNotifications: false` only when the app owns
notification routing and forwards the matching explicit lifecycle methods.
Call `stop()` when feedback should be cut immediately and `deactivate()` when
leaving the game surface. The SDK deliberately does not resume interrupted
gameplay tones or choose haptics for the app.

Use `TinyArcadeGameSessionV1` as the foreground gameplay owner. It combines at
most 32 touch/keyboard/controller sources without premature button releases,
advances only a bounded monotonic game clock, rejects background-sized frame
deltas and persists that exact clock through `TinyArcadeSnapshotStoreV1`. Feed
it deltas from `TinyArcadeFramePacerV1` using `CADisplayLink.timestamp` or an
equivalent monotonic source—not `Date`. On scene resignation call
`deactivateAndSave(to:)`; it clears controls and makes further input/ticks fail.
Before foreground presentation resumes, reset the pacer and call `activate()`.

When `TINYARCADE_EXTERNAL_CARTRIDGES` is deliberately enabled for SDK research,
reviewed downloads should be handed to `TinyArcadeCartridgeCacheV1.activate`
only after the app has received the complete response. The cache verifies the
signed entry and atomically selects it; `loadActive` and `rollback` recheck live
revocations before returning executable bytes. The cache performs no network
request, and private-user imports remain a separate origin and storage policy.

Decode official lobby metadata with `TinyArcadeCatalogV1.decode`. It bounds the
document, game count, strings, localizations, signed-entry encodings and
same-origin `{name}-{version}.wasm` filename. A generated
`tinyarcade://game/<game-id>` URL only selects an existing row; it never
downloads, activates or opens a cartridge. JSON discovery is not a substitute
for cache/trust verification.

`TinyArcadeHTTPSClientV1` streams official catalog and cartridge responses
through strict status, MIME, redirect, timeout, declared-length and received-byte
checks. It defaults to two active plus sixteen queued requests and exposes
smaller bounded limits. Task cancellation stops in-flight work or removes a
queued waiter. The returned cartridge `Data` must still be passed explicitly to
`TinyArcadeCartridgeCacheV1.activate`; transport success grants no provenance.

Use `TinyArcadeReviewedLibraryV1` for the complete official selection path. It
preflights downloaded bytes as a reviewed runtime before cache activation,
serializes installs across `await`, and reopens an active generation only after
live trust/revocation verification. This preserves the last playable cache
state when a signed cartridge needs native capabilities absent from the app.
Construction requires the explicit external-cartridge distribution policy.

Use `TinyArcadeSnapshotStoreV1` for scene/background persistence. It atomically
replaces one bounded file per canonical game id, stores the host-owned game
clock beside the runtime snapshot, applies iOS file protection and excludes the
directory from backup. `openSession` returns a fresh runtime when no save exists,
restores a compatible save, or discards a corrupt/incompatible save and creates
a second clean runtime so failed resume state cannot poison gameplay.

For reproducible bug reports or converter goldens, call
`beginReplayRecording()`, drive the game with ordinary `tick`/`tickMedia`, then
save or upload the bounded `Data` returned by `finishReplayRecording()`. Verify
received bytes on a disposable fresh runtime with `verifyReplay(_:)`; this
checks the runtime's exact loaded-cartridge hash and consumes its gameplay
state. Replay data contains no executable code and grants no native capability
or catalog trust.

Use `TinyArcadePrivateLibraryV1` when a user explicitly imports a cartridge
for personal play. It preflights the exact bytes with the core-only private
runtime before an atomic `game-id@version.wasm` install, excludes the bounded
library from backup, and revalidates canonical identity, size and regular-file
ownership whenever an item is enumerated or opened. It never downloads,
publishes, signs, or grants a native module. Construction requires the same
explicit external-cartridge distribution policy.

Generate a self-contained directory from the repository root:

```sh
rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios aarch64-apple-ios-sim x86_64-apple-ios
crates/tinyvm/build-swift-package.sh \
  dist/TinyArcadeRuntimePackage
```

An app may then add that directory as a local Swift package and depend on the
`TinyArcadeRuntime` product. The generated directory is a build artifact; this
template, the Swift source and Rust/C sources remain authoritative.
