//! Expression sugar → MVP wasm → tinyvm [`eval_wasm`].
//!
//! [`qjs2wasm`] lowers a name/op/host-call subset. The world lives in the
//! two [`eval_wasm`] bindings: `globals` (import table) and `locals` (this call).
//! Full JS is not a converter and is not this crate.
//!
//! Concept (Cloudflare Workers, design only — not V8/workerd/isolate/engine):
//! one untrusted guest per slot, language skin over the host door, limits in
//! the tinyvm core; container/OS is a later wrapping, not this crate.
