//! Deliberately a tree and not a byte stream. A single-pass parser that emitted
//! wasm as it went would be shorter today and unusable at M1: constant folding,
//! scope resolution, and control flow all need to look at a node more than
//! once. The tree is the seam that lets those passes exist.
//!
//! M0 nodes carry no source spans. Every diagnostic this milestone can produce
//! is raised during lexing or parsing, where the token offset is in hand; the
//! first lowering-time diagnostic (M1, an unresolved name) is what should add
//! them, rather than carrying unread fields until then.

/// A whole compilation unit. M0 accepts exactly one expression; the struct
/// exists so M1 can grow a statement list without changing the pipeline shape.
