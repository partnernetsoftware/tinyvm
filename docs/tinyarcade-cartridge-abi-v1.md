# TinyArcade standard WASM cartridge ABI v1

This document is the converter-facing contract for a TinyArcade cartridge.
A cartridge is an ordinary standard WebAssembly binary module. It has the standard
`.wasm` magic/version, standard sections and standard function imports/exports.
There are no tinyvm-only opcodes and no executable wrapper format.
The v1 runtime rejects an empty cartridge or any whole module above 2 MiB
before manifest/WASM parsing; transports should enforce the same ceiling while
downloading rather than use the runtime as a network buffer.

## Standard module and decode complexity

Standard non-custom sections must appear at most once, in WebAssembly-specified
order, and each parser must consume its complete declared payload. DataCount
(section id 12) is correctly ordered before code rather than numerically after
data. Unknown
non-custom section ids, duplicate/out-of-order sections and trailing bytes fail
before a `Module` exists. Custom sections may appear between standard sections;
they do not change ordering.

The v1 executable profile is MVP scalar instructions plus mutable globals,
tables/`call_indirect`, an internally defined multi-table `funcref` subset of
reference types,
the standard sign-extension and non-trapping
float-to-integer conversion proposals, extended constant expressions over
i32/i64 add/sub/mul, the standard multi-value and tail-call proposals, and
the standard bulk-memory proposal over its single memory and MVP funcref tables.
Any cartridge that uses linear-memory instructions or active data segments must
declare its standard memory section; the loader never supplies an implicit page.
Scalar load/store alignment exponents must not exceed each instruction's
natural width; lower alignments remain valid standard unaligned accesses.
Each function body is one canonical standard expression: its outer `end` is the
last body opcode and an `if` contains at most one `else`.
It accepts multi-result functions and type-indexed parameter/result signatures
on blocks, loops and ifs, all five integer
sign-extension instructions and all eight saturating float-to-integer
conversions. The `funcref` profile includes reference-typed values, locals and
globals, typed select, `ref.null`, `ref.is_null`, `ref.func`, table get/set/
grow/size/fill and expression element segment encodings 4 through 7. It also
accepts active/passive data and index-encoded funcref element segments,
`memory.init`, `data.drop`, `memory.copy`, `memory.fill`, `table.init`,
`elem.drop` and `table.copy`. DataCount is checked
against the data section and is mandatory when code uses a data-segment
instruction. A module may define multiple funcref tables: table instructions,
`call_indirect`, active element segments and cross-table `table.copy` use their
standard table indices. Defined-table exports are structurally validated;
imported tables, `externref`, typed function references, GC, SIMD, exceptions,
threads and multiple memories remain outside the TinyArcade v1 profile and fail
loudly at load time. This is feature negotiation by converter profile: future
runtimes may add standard proposals without changing the `.wasm` container or
inventing tinyvm-only opcodes.

Extended constant expressions may initialize globals and compute active data
or element offsets with wrapping `i32.add/sub/mul` and `i64.add/sub/mul`.
Validation executes them as typed stack programs: underflow, mixed operand
types or any final arity other than one rejects the cartridge. Their
instructions consume the shared decode complexity budget. The general tinyvm
engine supports constant `global.get` of an imported immutable numeric global
and evaluates dependent initializers only after exact host binding. TinyArcade
v1 rejects all global imports during both inspection and runtime opening, so
cartridges cannot use that engine capability. A defined guest global is never
substituted as an approximation.

This single-memory rule belongs to the game embedding, not the general engine.
tinyvm itself supports multiple standard memories, including
explicit scalar memargs, indexed active data and bulk operations, cross-memory
copy, and per-memory grow. TinyArcade v1 requires exactly one memory because its
core host callbacks, snapshot ranges and media submissions deliberately address
memory zero. The general VM also supports imported memories through explicit
host bindings with standard limits matching and shared store identity. Guest
writes/growth and host writes are visible across sibling instances, while
TinyArcade v1 rejects every memory import during inspection and opening.

The same profile boundary applies to imported globals: the general VM has
shared i32/i64/f32/f64/funcref/externref global bindings with exact type and
mutability, while TinyArcade v1 remains function-import-only. A non-null
externref is an opaque process-unique host identity, never a native pointer;
the embedding owns any associated object registry and lifetime.

The general embedding also resolves standard table, memory and global exports
by name. These are ordinary Wasm exports, not TinyArcade manifest aliases.
TinyArcade v1's callbacks continue to address its required memory zero.

`return_call` and `return_call_indirect` have their standard encodings and
validation rules. The target's complete result vector must equal the current
function's result vector. tinyvm executes defined tail chains with a trampoline,
so they consume deterministic instruction fuel but do not grow the native
Rust/iOS stack; an imported function may be the final tail target through the
same versioned host registry. Ordinary non-tail calls retain the host call-depth
ceiling.

Scalar instruction encodings and semantics follow the current
[WebAssembly core instruction specification](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/binary/instructions.html).
The segment flags, DataCount ordering, instruction immediates and drop semantics
follow the WebAssembly specification's
[bulk-memory proposal](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/blob/main/proposals/bulk-memory-operations/Overview.md).

Bulk copy/fill first bounds-check every range, then charge deterministic fuel
proportional to length (one unit per 16 bytes, in addition to the instruction
unit), then mutate memory. An out-of-bounds or fuel trap therefore cannot leave
a partial copy/fill behind. `memory.copy` has the standard overlap-safe memmove
semantics; `memory.fill` uses the low byte of its i32 value.
Table initialization/copy similarly checks both ranges and charges one fuel
unit per funcref before mutation. Passive data and element liveness is owned by
each instance: dropping a segment in one game cannot affect a sibling instance.
Active and declarative segments are unavailable to init after instantiation,
while a dropped segment still permits only source offset zero with length zero.
Table fill and grow likewise charge one deterministic fuel unit per affected
element before mutation; a fuel failure cannot partially fill or enlarge a
table. Growth obeys both the module-declared maximum and the host table budget.
`max_table_elems` is an aggregate instance limit across every table, both at
instantiation and growth, so splitting storage across tables cannot bypass it.

One module may materialize at most 262,144 allocation-amplifying decode records
in total. The shared count covers section entries, function parameter/result
types, local values, decoded instructions, element indices and `br_table`
targets. Raw custom/name/data bytes remain covered by the 2 MiB cartridge limit
and their section bounds. Allocation-amplifying guest-declared vectors are
budgeted before fallible reservation, so a tiny module declaring billions of
targets or locals returns a decode error before asking iOS to reserve that
guest-selected memory. This is a fixed TinyArcade ABI v1 compiler profile, not
a private bytecode extension: accepted files remain ordinary standards-valid
`.wasm`, and converter/runtime checks use the same gate.
Multi-value validation does not clone a type signature per nested control
frame: each frame stores constant-size views into the already-budgeted type
section. A large signature combined with deep nesting therefore cannot amplify
validation memory quadratically.

Guest function calls never recurse through the host language stack. Direct and
indirect calls use an explicit, fallibly grown VM activation vector; tail calls
replace its current activation. One top-level invocation admits at most 512
nested defined-call levels and 1,048,576 aggregate live locals, operand values
and control frames across the current function and suspended callers. Both
debug and release artifacts enforce the same limits. Exceeding either bound is
a typed runtime trap before another wide activation is allocated, while all
executed call instructions remain charged to ordinary deterministic fuel.
Net-positive operand/control growth is checked against those live limits and
fallibly reserved before the instruction can mutate guest state. Moving call
arguments or function results allocates the complete destination first, so an
allocator refusal leaves the source activation intact before trapping. A
decoded `br_table` borrows its range from a flat immutable per-function target
arena (avoiding both hot-path clones and per-table secondary allocations), and branch
result preservation uses overlap-safe movement inside the existing operand
allocation; a loop cannot amplify memory by cloning its guest-declared table on
every iteration.

## Required manifest custom section

Exactly one standard custom section named `tinyarcade.manifest.v1` is required.
After the standard custom-section name, its canonical payload is:

```text
"TAM1"                       4 bytes
abi_version                  u32 little-endian; must be 1
state_version                u32 little-endian; non-zero
game_id_length               u16 little-endian
game_id                      UTF-8; 3..128 [a-z0-9._-] bytes
game_version_length          u16 little-endian
game_version                 UTF-8; 1..64 [A-Za-z0-9._+-] bytes
native_capability_count      u16 little-endian; at most 64
repeated capability:
  namespace_length           u16 little-endian
  namespace                  UTF-8 versioned import module name
```

A native namespace uses the canonical form `authority:module/vN`, such as
`com.example:physics/v1`. Authority is a lower-case ASCII name and may use
dots for reverse-DNS ownership; module uses lower-case ASCII letters, digits,
`_` or `-`; `N` is a positive decimal major version without a leading zero.
Imported native function fields use lower-case ASCII `snake_case`, begin with a
letter and are at most 64 bytes. A breaking signature or semantic change must
use a new namespace major version; old namespaces are never silently rebound.
The manifest capability set must equal the set of non-core import module names in
the WASM module and is encoded in ascending byte order. Duplicate or unordered
declarations/imports, undeclared imports and unused declarations are rejected
before instantiation.

## Required guest exports

Every lifecycle export has the exact signature `() -> i32`. Zero means
success; any other result fails the lifecycle operation.

```text
game_abi_version  returns 1
game_init         called once after WASM start
game_tick         called once for a requested frame
game_suspend      submits guest state once
game_resume       loads guest state once
```

The runtime latches a guest trap, invalid lifecycle result or host-budget
violation. A failed instance cannot run another frame and must be discarded by
the app. Bad external snapshot bytes are rejected before guest execution and do
not poison a healthy instance.

The Rust embedding offers both an ownership-returning `tick` and `tick_into`.
The latter clears and recycles caller-owned render/audio buffers, including
their bounded capacity, while preserving the same guest-visible lifecycle and
trap semantics. This is a host allocation policy around ordinary standard Wasm
imports; it does not add a game opcode or change cartridge bytes.

## Core import namespace

Core services are optional standard function imports from
`tinyarcade:core/v1`. All values use the portable i32 ABI.
This i32-only rule belongs to TinyArcade core/native v1, not to tinyvm's
general WebAssembly host door: other embeddings may bind exact typed standard
imports carrying i64, f32, f64, funcref and opaque externref values through
the public `Val` API.

```text
input_bits() -> i32
clock_ms() -> i32
random_u32() -> i32
grid3d_version() -> i32
indexed2d_version() -> i32
indexed2d_metadata_version() -> i32
tones_version() -> i32
submit_render(pointer: i32, length: i32) -> i32
submit_audio(pointer: i32, length: i32) -> i32
save_state(pointer: i32, length: i32) -> i32
load_state(pointer: i32, capacity: i32) -> i32
```

`input_bits`, `clock_ms`, `random_u32`, and frame submissions are available
only during init/tick. `save_state` is available only during suspend;
`load_state` only during resume. Guest pointers are ranges in the module's
linear memory and are bounds-checked before native access.

A cartridge that emits `tinyarcade:grid3d/v1`, `tinyarcade:indexed2d/v1` or
`tinyarcade:tones/v1` must import the corresponding `grid3d_version`,
`indexed2d_version` or `tones_version`; the current host returns 1. The import
is the load-time compatibility declaration: an older runtime rejects the
unknown core import before instantiation, and the current runtime traps a
recognized media stream from a cartridge that omitted its declaration. A
cartridge should check every required version during init before relying on
that media schema.

An indexed2d frame with the application-metadata flag additionally requires
`indexed2d_metadata_version`; omitting it traps at submission. The base
`indexed2d_version` contract is unchanged, so old frames and old cartridges do
not acquire a new import. Hosts predating the extension reject a new cartridge
at ordinary WASM import resolution rather than partially decoding its state.

The v1 input bit assignments are:

```text
bit 0 left       bit 1 right      bit 2 up
bit 3 down       bit 4 primary    bit 5 secondary
bit 6 tertiary   bit 7 start      bit 8 menu
```

Time is host-provided monotonic game time, not wall-clock time. RNG is owned by
the host and its state is included in snapshots. Each lifecycle call may submit
render/audio/state at most once and only within host-selected byte ceilings.
The runtime rejects bits outside 0...8 and a clock below the preceding
successful tick before guest execution. This host-input error does not latch or
mutate the cartridge; the same or a later clock can continue. Successful resume
starts a new host-clock validation epoch because portable runtime snapshots do
not own the app's clock; the iOS snapshot envelope stores that clock beside the
runtime bytes.
Versioned, self-identifying media schemas are defined separately in
[`tinyarcade-media-stream-v1.md`](tinyarcade-media-stream-v1.md). Unknown magic,
unknown versions and malformed records must fail before native rendering or
audio scheduling.

## Native capability imports

Native modules remain standard WASM function imports. The native app must
explicitly register the exact namespace, field and i32 arity before loading a
cartridge. Importing a name does not grant it. Unknown namespaces, wrong
signatures and attempts to replace `tinyarcade:core/v1` fail closed.

Native capability callbacks are app code, not downloaded machine code. A
cartridge never carries dylibs, JIT output, device-side AOT output, JavaScript,
WASI or direct network access.

This deliberately leaves room for future app-native modules without coupling a
cartridge to tinyvm. A native module is compiled into a reviewed app build and
publishes a documented, versioned standard function-import namespace; the
`.wasm` cartridge contains only calls to that interface. Creator tools and
converters can therefore target a declared host profile, inspect compatibility
without running the game, and keep emitting the same standards-valid module for
another conforming interpreter. A new native implementation, optional function,
or breaking behavior must not reinterpret an existing namespace/version.

The public iOS ABI registers at most 64 exact functions per runtime and limits
each to 16 i32 parameters, 16 i32 results and a host-selected 1...64 calls per
lifecycle. The quota resets for init/tick/suspend/resume and is charged before
dispatch, so an over-budget call never reaches app code. A callback runs
synchronously on the runtime owner thread, may read/write guest linear memory
only during that call, and latches the cartridge on callback failure. Core
imports and the iOS C callback path use fixed 16-value parameter/result staging.
Before app code can mutate memory or host state, the VM fallibly reserves either
the suspended caller stack or a top-level result destination; nested calls then
append inline results directly without a temporary heap `Vec`. This is a compatibility door, not an ambient native API: a host should expose the smallest versioned
module needed by the reviewed game and may decline a manifest capability even
when the app binary implements it.

Native callback implementations are trusted, app-compiled parts of that module
contract. They must bound every guest-derived offset/count and complete without
blocking. A synchronous borrowed-memory callback cannot be safely killed by a
wall-clock timer; post-return timing is telemetry, not containment. Cartridge
containment therefore combines WASM fuel with the pre-dispatch native call
quota, while each shipped native module owns a deterministic finite-work rule.

The exact function import table is the machine-readable interface descriptor:
module namespace, field, parameter count and result count all come from normal
WASM sections. Rust `CartridgeDescriptor::inspect`, `tinyvm cartridge inspect`
and iOS `TinyArcadeCartridgeDescriptorV1.inspect` all use the same structural
validator without instantiating the module, running its start function or
calling guest code. Converters should preserve standard WASM imports and use
this table to report missing host modules; they must not rewrite imports into
private opcodes. A capability declaration is a compatibility requirement, not
an entitlement: cartridge origin and host policy still decide whether a module
is registered.

The C ABI v1.8 two-stage copy function emits the following canonical host-side
descriptor. `TAD1` is inspection output, not a cartridge wrapper and never
replaces the original standard `.wasm` bytes.

```text
"TAD1"                       4 bytes
schema_version               u16 little-endian; 1
header_length                u16 little-endian; 32
abi_version                  u32 little-endian
state_version                u32 little-endian
game_id_length               u16 little-endian
game_version_length          u16 little-endian
native_capability_count      u16 little-endian; at most 64
function_import_count        u16 little-endian; at most 72
wasm_length                  u32 little-endian; exact inspected bytes
reserved                     u32 zero
game_id                      exact UTF-8 bytes
game_version                 exact UTF-8 bytes
repeated native capability:
  namespace_length           u16 little-endian
  namespace                  exact UTF-8 bytes
repeated function import:
  module_length              u16 little-endian
  field_length               u16 little-endian
  parameter_count            u8; at most 16
  result_count               u8; at most 16
  class                      u8; 0 core, 1 native
  reserved                   u8 zero
  module                     exact UTF-8 bytes
  field                      exact UTF-8 bytes
```

Descriptor success proves structural ABI compatibility only. Runtime-specific
memory/step/media limits, native registry availability, catalog trust and guest
initialization remain later independent gates.

## Manifest authoring

An ordinary WebAssembly producer does not need linker-specific custom-section
syntax. The converter CLI can attach the canonical section after compilation:

```text
tinyvm cartridge attach-manifest INPUT.wasm OUTPUT.wasm GAME_ID GAME_VERSION ABI_VERSION STATE_VERSION
```

The command first parses the input as standard WASM, derives the sorted unique
native capability set from its non-core function-import namespaces, appends one
standard custom section, and runs the complete static cartridge descriptor
validator before publishing. The capability list is deliberately not a CLI
argument: the standard import table is its sole source of truth. Input bytes are
preserved as the exact prefix of the output; an existing manifest, incompatible
lifecycle/import contract, output over 2 MiB or existing output path fails
without publishing or overwriting an artifact. Run this as the final post-link,
post-optimization step so a producer optimizer cannot strip the manifest.

A fan-facing converter should publish both the resulting `.wasm` and its
machine-readable descriptor/compatibility report. Its target is an explicit
TinyArcade host profile: core ABI version, media versions, exact native
namespace/function signatures and resource ceilings. It must not probe tinyvm
implementation details or rewrite missing host functions into private opcodes.
The canonical app-build profile is
[`tinyarcade-host-profile-v1.md`](tinyarcade-host-profile-v1.md); its static
check deliberately remains separate from dynamic fuel/output conformance.

Library-based converters may use `CartridgeManifest::append_to_wasm` for the
same deterministic canonical encoding. That low-level method validates the
manifest and section framing and refuses to rewrite an existing manifest; the
caller must still run `CartridgeDescriptor::inspect` to prove the complete game
contract before distribution.

The executable [C authoring path](tinyarcade-c-authoring-v1.md) proves this is
not a Rust- or tinyvm-specific producer contract: a freestanding LLVM C module
passes the same converter, runtime, JavaScriptCore and browser oracles.

## Snapshot envelope

The app persists the bytes returned by runtime suspend. The canonical envelope
is:

```text
"TGS1"                       4 bytes
abi_version                  u32 little-endian
state_version                u32 little-endian
game_id_length               u16 little-endian
game_id                      exact manifest UTF-8 bytes
host_rng_state               u32 little-endian
guest_state_length           u32 little-endian
guest_state                  bytes submitted by save_state
```

Resume requires an exact game id, ABI version and state version, consumes the
whole envelope, restores the host RNG and exposes only the guest payload to
`load_state`. Cartridge authors increment `state_version` whenever saved bytes
are no longer backward compatible.

## Converter conformance checklist

1. Emit a standards-valid WebAssembly module within the v1 executable profile,
   then attach exactly one canonical
   manifest without rewriting its executable sections.
   Numeric immediates must fit their standard signed or unsigned LEB widths;
   host integer truncation is never cartridge validation.
   Every custom section must retain its standard UTF-8 name envelope even when
   its opaque payload is ignored by tinyvm.
   A missing or empty memory-section vector declares no linear memory, so such
   a cartridge must not contain memory instructions or active data segments.
   `global.set` may target only a global declared mutable; converters must not
   rely on a later execution trap for an immutable write.
2. Export all five exact lifecycle functions.
3. Derive every manifest capability from the standard non-core import table;
   never maintain a second hand-written capability list.
4. Use only registered, versioned i32 capability imports.
5. Treat input/time/RNG as injected deterministic state.
6. Check host-call results and stay within linear-memory and output budgets.
7. Save all game-owned deterministic state; never save native pointers.
8. Pass the runtime black-box suite before a cartridge is eligible for either
   private import or the reviewed catalog.

All host query-then-copy consumers must require the successful copy length to
equal the preceding query length; length drift is an ABI decode failure.
