# TinyArcade host profile v1

A TAH1 host profile is a deterministic, callback-free description of one
reviewed app build. It lets converters and creator sites compare a standard
`.wasm` cartridge with the exact TinyArcade ABI, resource ceilings, media
versions and app-compiled native import signatures available in that build.
It is compatibility metadata, not executable code, catalog trust or permission
to install a cartridge.

## Canonical binary

All integers are little-endian. The complete artifact is at most 64 KiB.

```text

max_activation_slots          u32; non-zero aggregate live VM slots
reserved                      u32; zero
accepted_wasm_features        u32; canonical bitmap described below
repeated native function, sorted by module then field bytes:
  module_length               u16
  field_length                u16
  parameter_count             u8; at most 16
  result_count                u8; at most 16
  reserved                    u16; zero
  max_calls_per_lifecycle     u32; 1...64
  module                      canonical authority:module/vN UTF-8
  field                       canonical snake_case UTF-8
```

The feature bitmap assigns bits in this order: bulk memory, sign extension,
nontrapping float-to-int, multi-value, reference types, multiple tables,
multiple memories, extended constant expressions, tail calls, and
`simd-signed-pcm-v1`. Scalar WebAssembly is implicit. The last bit names only
tinyvm's reviewed `v128` load/store/constant plus signed saturating i16x8 PCM
add/sub subset; it never claims complete WebAssembly SIMD.
These bits describe proposal families recognized by the exact decoder build;
they do not override game-profile structural rules such as the required single
linear memory. Full profile inspection remains authoritative.

Decoders also accept schema-1 (56 bytes), schema-2 (64 bytes), and schema-3
(68 bytes). Schema 1
predates configurable call resources and maps deterministically to 512 live
defined activations and 1,048,576 aggregate activation slots. Schemas 1 and 2
predate indexed2d application metadata and therefore report that core import
unavailable during compatibility checks. All three older schemas predate the
feature bitmap and conservatively map to the accepted non-SIMD profile. Encoders
always emit schema 4. This preserves already published profiles without falsely
claiming a newer host capability.

Duplicate, unordered, malformed, unknown-version and trailing data fail closed.
Changing any limit, media version, namespace, signature or quota changes the
profile bytes and therefore its content hash.

The three game byte ceilings use zero as an exact capability restriction, not
as “unlimited” or “use a default.” This matches the runtime configuration: a
guest attempting a non-empty submission traps at the normal output/state
budget, while a stateless guest may explicitly save and restore zero bytes.

## Compatibility meaning

```text
standard cartridge
  → manifest + lifecycle + standard import validation
  → declared initial memory/table checked against TAH1
  → every used accepted-proposal family present in the exact-build bitmap
  → every native import matched by exact module/field/i32 signature
  → compatible for installation preflight
  → dynamic fuel/output/native-semantic conformance still required
```

The profile cannot prove the amount of fuel, output or call resources a guest
will consume; those values are runtime ceilings and must still be exercised by
converter goldens and reviewed game testing. `max_calls_per_lifecycle` describes host
containment but is not a promise that an arbitrary native callback has the
semantics expected by a game. Catalog signature, origin, revocation and the
App Store external-code release gate remain independent later decisions.

Native functions are implementations already compiled into the app. TAH1
contains only their standard WASM interface and finite call quota. Publishing
TAH1 therefore lets fan converters target a concrete app build without
publishing callbacks, dylibs, JIT/AOT products or tinyvm internals.

## Canonical compatibility report

C ABI v1.13 and Swift carry the complete static result as a bounded TAC1
artifact. All integers are little-endian and the complete report is at most
64 KiB:

```text
"TAC1"                       4 bytes
schema_version                u16; exactly 2
header_length                 u16; exactly 20
issue_count                   u16; at most 72
reserved                      u16; zero
descriptor_length             u32
unsupported_wasm_features     u32; same canonical bitmap as TAH1
descriptor                    exact canonical TAD1 bytes
repeated issue; indexed2d-metadata availability first when present, then
native issues in cartridge import order:
  module_length               u16; 1...128
  field_length                u16; 1...64
  required_parameter_count    u8; at most 16
  required_result_count       u8; at most 16
  available_parameter_count   u8; at most 16, or 255 when missing
  available_result_count      u8; at most 16, or 255 when missing
  module                      canonical UTF-8 bytes
  field                       canonical UTF-8 bytes
```

Decoders retain TAC1 schema-1 compatibility; its absent feature bitmap maps to
zero. The two available counts are either both present or both `255`. A
compatible report has a zero unsupported-feature bitmap and zero issues but
still carries the profile-bound descriptor. An
incompatible report is successful report data rather than a guest trap;
malformed WASM, malformed TAH1 and resource-limit failures remain errors. TAC1
is callback-free, performs no instantiation and grants no install authority.

## Tool and iOS flow

The core-only default profile can be produced and inspected without an app:

```sh
tinyvm host-profile default ios-build.tahost
tinyvm host-profile inspect ios-build.tahost
tinyvm cartridge check-profile game.wasm ios-build.tahost
```

`check-profile` prints a stable key/value compatibility report. A compatible
cartridge reports `compatibility_issues=0` and `compatible=true`. A valid but
incompatible cartridge still reports its identity and one `issue=` row per
unavailable feature or native import, distinguishing an unsupported proposal,
a wholly missing function and an exact parameter/result signature mismatch; it
then exits unsuccessfully. Parse, resource-limit and malformed-profile errors
remain separate failures rather than being flattened into compatibility issues.

Library converters use `HostProfileV1::compatibility_report` for the same
non-executing result. Each issue carries the required module, field and arity,
plus the available arity when that app build has the same named function with
the wrong signature. `unsupported_features` independently identifies proposal
families the cartridge uses but the target app build does not advertise.
`inspect_cartridge` remains the fail-fast compatibility door for existing
consumers.

Rust app hosts use `NativeModuleRegistry::host_profile`; C hosts use the
two-stage `tinyarcade_v1_copy_host_profile`; Swift uses
`TinyArcadeHostProfileV1.appBuild`. All three encode the same TAH1 bytes.
`inspect_cartridge`, `tinyarcade_v1_check_cartridge_host_profile` and
`inspectCompatibleCartridge` share the same non-executing compatibility gate.
The C `tinyarcade_v1_copy_host_compatibility_report` and Swift
`compatibilityReport(for:)` surfaces preserve every typed mismatch for creator
UI instead of flattening incompatibility to one error string.

An app owner publishes the exact artifact as `host-profile-v1.tahost` beside
`catalog-v1.json`; the catalog records its bounded length and SHA-256 so a site
or converter can select an exact target. The iOS client treats those fields as
discovery only and accepts downloaded bytes only when they exactly equal TAH1
generated from the local App build. A creator upload must bind those selected
bytes or digest so a later app build cannot be confused with the one the
converter targeted. Passing TAH1 does not promote a private-user upload into
the official reviewed catalog.
