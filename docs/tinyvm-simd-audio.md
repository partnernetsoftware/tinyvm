# tinyvm optional SIMD game-kernel profile

Owner: [tinyvm PRD](../prd/PRD.md)

Status: implemented, optional workload profile

The Cargo feature `simd` enables a bounded standard WebAssembly SIMD subset
inside the unified `tinyvm` crate. It is deliberately driven by game
runtime jobs: saturated signed PCM mixing, whole-vector masks for packed flags
or pixel composition, byte shuffle/swizzle for codecs, wrapping integer lanes
for coordinates, counters and deterministic fixed-point state, signed/unsigned
integer comparison masks for collision and pixel tests, and the scalar/vector
lane bridge emitted by portable C/Rust SIMD frontends. It is not a claim that
the complete SIMD proposal is implemented.

All vector bytes use standard little-endian lane order and portable scalar Rust
semantics. The interpreter does not emit host vector instructions and does not
depend on the host ISA. Whole-vector logic operates on the canonical 16 bytes;
`bitselect(a, b, mask)` chooses each bit from `a` where the mask bit is one and
from `b` otherwise. `v128.load` and `v128.store` validate natural alignment
immediates and preflight the complete 16-byte memory range. Signed lanes use
Rust's defined `i16::saturating_add` and `i16::saturating_sub`, including both
overflow boundaries. Integer lane arithmetic uses the corresponding wrapping
operation at each lane width, so overflow is deterministic in debug and
release builds and independent of host ISA. Integer comparisons cover every
standard relation for each accepted lane width and produce the standard all-one or all-zero mask in every
lane; signed and unsigned order are kept distinct. Lane immediates are
range-checked during decoding; extraction sign-extends only the standard signed
8- and 16-bit
forms, while replacement keeps the low lane bits. Float lanes preserve their
exact IEEE-754 bytes. `all_true` tests complete lanes for nonzero values;
`bitmask` packs each lane's most-significant bit into the corresponding scalar
bit, following standard lane order.

Any other `0xfd` instruction is rejected during module decoding with a typed
unsupported-opcode error. When the Cargo feature is absent, the first SIMD
instruction fails explicitly as `SIMD feature is disabled`; default and
`staticcore` builds therefore retain their existing semantics and size.

## Evidence

`smoke-wabt-simd-audio.sh` compiles the 1,467-byte workload independently with
WABT, validates it with `wasm-validate`, then runs the same lane vectors through
tinyvm, macOS JavaScriptCore and an actual headless H5 browser. The three
runtimes produce the same saturated lanes, six nontrivial mask vectors and
`any_true` results for both nonzero and zero inputs, plus eleven wrapping
add/subtract/multiply vectors across 8-, 16-, 32- and 64-bit lanes and
representative signed/unsigned comparison masks across all four widths. A Rust
black-box table separately executes true and false cases for all 36 accepted
integer comparison opcodes and both scalar reductions for every integer lane
width. The engines also compare every byte from six
splats, six replacements and every integer/float
extraction family. The audio lanes are:

```text
add: 32767,-32768,300,-300,32767,-32768,-5000,5000
sub: 20000,-20000,-100,100,32766,-32767,32767,-32768
```

The Rust black box also covers v128 function/local/global/constant values,
rejects scalar lane operands, scalar or missing mask operands and an
over-aligned load, and proves an out-of-bounds store leaves the destination tail
unchanged. The optional profile stores v128 inline and keeps `Val` at 24 bytes;
there is no heap allocation or native handle per vector.

The default stripped static core remains 101,256 bytes under its unchanged
100 KiB gate. The optional profile is 117,800 bytes under its separate 120 KiB
gate. With the current complete iOS host owners, the SIMD build links at
1,810,808 bytes arm64 and 1,914,336 bytes x86_64, under separate explicit
opt-in ceilings; those budgets do not weaken the default product boundaries.

A separate manifest-bearing TinyArcade cartridge performs the same add and
subtract operations during `game_init`, checks both saturation extremes, then
executes every splat/extract/replace family before it renders one indexed frame
and round-trips its 16-byte state. With an
`ios-c-api,simd` XCFramework, the Swift/C ABI opens and executes that cartridge
on the booted iPhone 17 Pro Simulator. The focused linked consumer is 1,617,704
bytes with the current game-kernel profile.
