# TinyArcade catalog transport v1

The official lobby index is bounded discovery metadata. It is not executable
authority and its JSON bytes are not signed as a substitute for a cartridge
record. Selecting an item yields one `TinyArcadeReviewedCatalogEntry`; the
downloaded bytes must still pass the signed-entry trust store and verified
cache before a reviewed runtime can open them.

```text
catalog JSON
├── shows bounded title/summary/localizations
├── discovers one bounded app-build TAH1 artifact
├── resolves one same-origin cartridge filename
├── carries the detached signed-entry fields
└── never activates code
    └── complete response
        → signed entry verification
        → atomic verified cache
        → reviewed runtime open
```

## Document

The UTF-8 JSON document is at most 1 MiB and contains 1...256 current games.
One `game_id` appears at most once, so a deep link cannot ambiguously select
among versions. Numbers are JSON integers within their declared unsigned
ranges.

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "catalog_id": "com.example.tinyarcade",
  "host_profile": {
    "file": "host-profile-v1.tahost",
    "length": 56,
    "sha256": "<64-lowercase-hex-characters>"
  },
  "games": [
    {
      "game_id": "com.example.paddle-guard",
      "game_version": "0.1.0",
      "title": "Paddle Guard",
      "summary": "Defend the field.",
      "localizations": {
        "zh-Hans": {
          "title": "护盾弹球",
          "summary": "守住球场。"
        }
      },
      "cartridge": "paddle-guard-0.1.0.wasm",
      "abi_version": 1,
      "state_version": 1,
      "wasm_length": 5280,
      "wasm_sha256": "<64-lowercase-hex-characters>",
      "signing_key_id": "catalog-2026-a",
      "signature": "<canonical-base64-of-64-bytes>"
    }
  ]
}
```

`catalog_id`, `game_id` and `signing_key_id` use bounded lowercase ASCII
identifier characters (`a-z`, `0-9`, `.`, `_`, `-`). Versions use bounded
ASCII alphanumerics plus `.`, `_`, `+`, `-`. Title and summary are nonblank,
with 256-byte and 1,024-byte UTF-8 ceilings. At most 16 BCP-47-shaped language
tags are accepted per game. Lookup tries an exact case-insensitive tag and then
removes trailing subtags before falling back to the default text.

`wasm_sha256` is exactly 32 bytes encoded as lowercase hex. `signature` is the
canonical Base64 encoding of exactly 64 bytes. These fields reconstruct the
signed record specified by `docs/tinyarcade-signed-catalog-v1.md`; display text
and transport location do not gain signature authority merely by sharing the
same JSON object. Unknown JSON members are transport extensions and cannot
change the fields passed to the trust gate.

`host_profile` is optional so an older catalog remains readable. When present,
its file is exactly `host-profile-v1.tahost`, its length is 56...65,536 bytes,
its digest is lowercase SHA-256 and its URL resolves on the same origin as the
cartridges. The metadata is discovery/content-addressing data, not execution
authority. The App downloads it under the declared exact-length ceiling, then
compares the bytes with the canonical TAH1 generated from its own compiled
runtime configuration and native registry. A catalog cannot grant itself an
extra native import or resource limit by changing both its profile and hash.

## Cartridge URL

The app supplies an HTTPS directory URL, such as
`https://partnernetsoftware.com/wasm/`. `cartridge` is one ASCII filename, not a
URL: it contains no slash, traversal, query, fragment or percent-encoded path,
ends in `-<game_version>.wasm`, and resolves on the same scheme/host/port as the
directory. A configurable positive per-cartridge ceiling defaults to 8 MiB.
The catalog document URL and cartridge directory must also share the same
scheme, host and port before the client starts a request.

The conventional publication layout is therefore:

```text
https://partnernetsoftware.com/wasm/
├── catalog-v1.json
├── host-profile-v1.tahost
├── depth-well-0.1.0.wasm
└── paddle-guard-0.1.0.wasm
```

`TinyArcadeHTTPSClientV1` is the reference app-side transport. It uses ephemeral
HTTPS GET requests, requests identity encoding, clamps timeout to 5...120
seconds, rejects every redirect and requires HTTP 200. Catalog responses require
`application/json`; cartridge responses require `application/wasm` or
`application/octet-stream`. A declared length above the ceiling fails before
body acceptance, every received delegate chunk rechecks the remaining budget,
and a cartridge's final received length must exactly match its signed entry.
Task cancellation cancels the URLSession task and resumes the caller once.
Host-profile responses require `application/octet-stream` or
`application/vnd.tinyarcade.host-profile`, have an exact declared/final length,
and must equal the App-local TAH1 bytes before being accepted.

One client allows 1...4 active requests (default 2) and 0...64 queued requests
(default 16). The same active limit is applied to URLSession's per-host
connections. A saturated queue returns typed `requestQueueFull`; queued task
cancellation removes and resumes that waiter rather than retaining it until a
network slot opens. Thus both bytes and request ownership are bounded.

The client returns discovery or cartridge bytes only. It does not activate the
cache, open a runtime, add authentication headers or expose network to a guest.
The reference composition is `TinyArcadeReviewedLibraryV1`:

```text
selected catalog row
    → bounded same-origin HTTPS bytes
    → reviewed runtime open/preflight under live trust + native registry
    → verified cache activation
    → ready officialReviewed runtime
```

This ordering prevents a correctly signed but currently uninstantiable
cartridge from displacing a playable generation. The library serializes
installs across Swift actor reentrancy, checks cancellation before preflight and
activation, closes a preflight runtime if activation fails, and never treats
HTTP success as reviewed provenance.

## Deep links

The stable selection form is `tinyarcade://game/<game_id>`. It must contain
exactly one path component and no user info, port, query or fragment. Resolution
returns the already-decoded catalog item only. In particular, flags such as
`?run=1` are rejected and resolving a link performs no network, cache or runtime
operation. The lobby remains responsible for presenting the selected item and
starting any reviewed acquisition flow explicitly.

Private-user imports are not catalog rows and do not acquire public discovery,
reviewed labels or shareable deep links through this format.
