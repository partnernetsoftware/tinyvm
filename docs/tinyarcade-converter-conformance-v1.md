# TinyArcade converter conformance v1

Fan tools should emit an ordinary standards-valid WebAssembly `.wasm`, not a
TinyArcade bytecode wrapper. The app-specific contract consists only of
standard imports, exports, a standard custom manifest section and versioned
media/state records. The accepted v1 compiler profile includes the scalar MVP,
the standard sign-extension and non-trapping float-to-integer conversion
proposals, standard extended constant expressions over i32/i64 add/sub/mul,
the standard multi-value proposal, the internally defined
multiple-table `funcref`
reference profile, the standard tail-call proposal, plus the standard
bulk-memory proposal for one memory and
funcref tables: copy/fill, passive
data/element segments, init/drop and table.copy. It is a bounded standards
profile, not a different VM instruction set.

Run the same black-box gate used by the runtime repository:

```sh
cargo run -p tinyvm --bin tinyvm -- \
  cartridge inspect path/to/game.wasm

cargo run -p tinyvm --bin tinyvm -- \
  cartridge check path/to/game.wasm

cargo run -p tinyvm --bin tinyvm -- \
  cartridge check path/to/game.wasm --json

cargo run -p tinyvm --bin tinyvm -- \
  cartridge check-profile path/to/game.wasm path/to/app-build.tahost

cargo run -p tinyvm --bin tinyvm -- \
  cartridge check-profile path/to/game.wasm path/to/app-build.tahost --json

cargo run -p tinyvm --bin tinyvm --features replay -- \
  replay check path/to/game.wasm path/to/game.tareplay --json
```

`inspect` parses canonical identity/schema metadata and the normal WASM import
table without executing guest code. It reports every import's namespace,
function field, i32 signature and core/native classification so a converter can
give an exact compatibility report. `check` uses the private-import policy and
therefore rejects every native module import. It then enforces a 2 MiB file
ceiling, 64 memory pages, 1,024
table elements, one million interpreted instructions per lifecycle call and
the ordinary frame/audio/state byte budgets. The table ceiling is the
aggregate live element count across all internally defined tables.

After the first bounded tick, `check` reports `render_stream`, exact render
length, `application_metadata_schema` and `application_metadata_bytes` as
stable key/value rows. A base grid3d/indexed2d frame reports `none` and `0`;
an indexed2d metadata trailer reports its non-zero schema as eight lowercase
hex digits and its validated length. Tools may display those values or route a
known game-owned schema, but must not reinterpret the opaque payload as a
TinyArcade-global state format.

The optional trailing `--json` emits the versioned
[`tinyarcade-cartridge-conformance-report` v1](tinyarcade-cartridge-conformance-report-v1.md).
It includes the exact converter limits and deterministic execution statistics
for init, both tick paths, suspend, fresh-instance init and resume. Static,
initialization, media, lifecycle and byte-determinism failures remain distinct
machine-readable stages. Catalog publication calls this same structured gate;
it does not maintain a weaker duplicate implementation.

`check-profile` targets one exact app-build TAH1. It does not execute the
cartridge. Success reports zero compatibility issues; failure enumerates each
missing native function or same-name signature mismatch with the exact required
and available arities. Converter UI should surface those rows directly instead
of reducing them to “unsupported game.”

The optional trailing `--json` emits the stable, versioned
[`tinyarcade-host-compatibility-report` v1](tinyarcade-host-compatibility-report-v1.md).
Compatible, incompatible and malformed-input paths all produce one parseable
object; exit status still distinguishes acceptance from rejection. This is the
preferred interface for creator sites and CI. The original text output remains
available for humans and existing scripts.

`replay check ... --json` verifies a representative, author-owned input/clock
trace rather than only the fixed lifecycle probe. Its versioned
[`tinyarcade-replay-conformance-report` v1](tinyarcade-replay-conformance-report-v1.md)
separates trace decoding, exact cartridge binding, runtime initialization and
per-frame output drift. Creator sites and CI should retain both the fixed
lifecycle report and one or more meaningful gameplay replay reports; neither
claim substitutes for the other.

The offline official-catalog publisher requires one passing non-empty replay
per source game and invokes this same byte-level checker before signing. The
trace remains review/CI evidence and is not added to the app's runtime download
surface.

For proposal diagnostics, `tinyvm module validate FILE.wasm` also prints the
post-MVP families actually used by the accepted bytes as
`standard_features=`. This is usage metadata, not a request to lower missing
features into private opcodes. A converter should show it before attaching the
TinyArcade manifest so authors can compare compiler output with the documented
cartridge baseline.

```

Two compiler-produced reference cartridges own both media branches:
`depth-well-0.1.0.wasm` exercises `grid3d/v1`, while
`paddle-guard-0.1.0.wasm` exercises `indexed2d/v1`. Both are ordinary standard
WASM modules built through the shared `build-rust-cartridge.sh` profile. Their
real Rust output retains `memory.copy`/`memory.fill` and DataCount instead of
lowering bulk work into MVP loops; neither receives a fixture-only loader.

The independent bulk-memory development gate compiles checked-in WAT with
WABT, validates the generated module with `wasm-validate`, then executes those
same bytes in tinyvm and system JavaScriptCore. Run
`crates/tinyvm/smoke-wabt-bulk-memory.sh`; both engines must return 143
from a module that exercises passive data and funcref element lifetimes.
`smoke-wabt-scalar-proposals.sh` applies the same WABT validation and exact-byte
tinyvm/JavaScriptCore comparison to all five sign-extension and all eight
saturating conversion instructions; both engines must return 143.
`smoke-wabt-extended-const.sh` covers typed and nested integer constant
expressions in global, data and element initializers; all three engines must
return 199 from the same WABT-produced bytes.
`smoke-wabt-imported-globals.sh` covers standard immutable and mutable numeric
global imports, constant `global.get`, active segment offsets and shared store
identity; WABT validation, tinyvm and JavaScriptCore agree on result `878897`.
This is a general-engine conformance case: TinyArcade v1 cartridge inspection
deliberately rejects global imports.
Both imported values come from a separately WABT-compiled provider module's
standard exports, so the oracle proves live module-to-module global identity
rather than only two instances sharing host-constructed values.
`smoke-wabt-resource-exports.sh` independently covers named table, memory and
global exports plus host mutation; WABT validates the bytes and tinyvm and
JavaScriptCore both return `76`.
`smoke-wabt-imported-memory.sh` covers the general VM's standard imported
memory binding, active data, shared sibling writes/growth, exact limits and
alias identity. WABT validates all fixtures; tinyvm and JavaScriptCore agree
after obtaining the shared memory from a separately compiled provider
module's standard export, not a host-created stand-in. TinyVM promotes the
defined allocation into a cloneable handle only when the embedding requests
it, preserving the direct-memory execution path otherwise.
They agree on the single-import result `516`, while a multi-index alias test proves
overlap-safe copy result `593`. TinyArcade v1 deliberately rejects this general
engine capability.
`smoke-wabt-imported-table.sh` covers the general VM's imported-table work:
WABT compiles a provider whose defined exported table already contains a
provider function and a consumer that imports and invokes it after the provider
handle is dropped. It also validates imported table zero plus defined table
one, binding and active initialization through that same store object. A
two-index alias fixture proves one aggregate allocation plus overlap-safe copy
result `16`. Table cells carry their originating instance identity; tinyvm and
JavaScriptCore agree on sibling dispatch result `4`. TinyVM additionally runs a
4,000-call A/B cycle with shared fuel/depth/activation accounting through the
store trampoline. TinyArcade v1 rejects table imports.
`smoke-wabt-imported-functions.sh` covers standard function export/import
linking without native callback wrappers. WABT compiles and validates separate
provider, consumer and relay modules; tinyvm and JavaScriptCore execute the
same bytes to `4242424` through an ordinary call, cross-instance tail call,
an imported-function re-export and mixed i32/i64/f32/f64 parameters/results.
The same fixture round-trips a consumer function reference through the provider
and calls it from a table, then imports a provider funcref global and calls its
original function after the public provider handle is dropped. TinyVM rejects
signature and foreign-store mismatches before execution. This is general
multi-module VM conformance and does not change TinyArcade v1's one-cartridge
product contract.
`smoke-wabt-multi-value.sh` covers multi-result functions, parameterized
block/loop/if signatures, loop parameters, implicit else identity and
multi-value `br_if`/`br_table`; all three engines must return 143.
`smoke-wabt-funcref.sh` covers funcref values/locals/globals, typed select,
reference and table instructions, expression element segments, table bulk
operations and indirect calls; WABT, tinyvm and JavaScriptCore must return 143.
`smoke-wabt-multi-table.sh` uses two defined tables and covers indexed active
segments, cross-table get/set/copy/init, indirect calls, growth/fill/size and a
table export; all three engines must return 143. The runtime's table-element
limit is the aggregate across those tables.
`smoke-wabt-tail-call.sh` executes 100,000 direct self tail calls followed by an
indirect tail call; WABT, tinyvm and JavaScriptCore must return 143 from the
same module. This also proves that the tinyvm execution path is a trampoline,
not native-stack recursion. Converter output may target these standard
instructions without a tinyvm-specific lowering.

Before upload, a converter may additionally consume the exact app-build TAH1
profile defined in
[`tinyarcade-host-profile-v1.md`](tinyarcade-host-profile-v1.md).
`tinyvm cartridge check-profile` compares standard imports and declared
memory/table requirements without executing the guest or native callbacks.
This does not replace the dynamic lifecycle/media/determinism checks below:
step, frame, audio and state ceilings describe failure policy, not statically
provable guest behavior.

Converters should also retain deterministic replay vectors for representative
gameplay and every bug they fix. `tinyvm replay record` turns a bounded
`clock_ms buttons` input plan into a canonical `.tareplay`; `tinyvm replay
check` binds it to the exact cartridge SHA-256 and regenerates every render and
audio digest. The wire format, ceilings, commands and checked-in Depth
Well/Paddle Guard goldens are specified in
[`docs/tinyarcade-replay-v1.md`](tinyarcade-replay-v1.md).

During converter and runtime development, the same replay can also be executed
by a second standards implementation. On macOS the repository's
`smoke-webkit-differential.sh` runs the unmodified `.wasm` in the system
JavaScriptCore WebAssembly engine with the same snapshot, RNG, input and clock,
then compares every render/audio length and SHA-256 with tinyvm. This is a
differential oracle, not a substitute runtime: a match increases confidence in
WASM/ABI semantics, while a mismatch must be reduced and adjudicated against
the WebAssembly and TinyArcade contracts.

The oracle is development-only. It has no DOM, browser UI or network surface;
JavaScriptCore, JavaScript and H5 are not linked into the nostalgia-arcade iOS
runtime. A browser preview may be useful to a cartridge author, but passing one
does not grant App compatibility, catalog trust or Apple distribution approval.

Passing this command establishes technical compatibility for a user's private
library. It does not sign, publish or approve the game for the official catalog.
Official review additionally owns product quality, rights/provenance, metadata,
policy and the signed catalog record.
